##### DEV_HISTORY FOR ppl.tits #####
# -------------------------------- #
# -------------------------------- #

# NOTE: all comments in this file or in this project are first meant for future me and, second,
# for other so they can reproduce my work. That is why there are so many of them, so anyone can
# do what I did, regardless of his/her own experience. Note also that English and R are not my
# native tongues, so please forgive any mistakes.
# NOTE: As you'll see, I chose to develop an R package alongside a {targets} pipeline to organise
# my data analysis procedure. HOWEVER, it is quite time consuming and, once you've understand how
# to use {targets} and {renv} and if you do not actually need to share your package, then using a
# simple {targets} project (coupled with {renv}) is largely sufficient! Think about it next time
# rather than always developing a package!
# Note also that I briefly explain how to use {targets} at the end of this document and I will add
# {renv} later, if I can.



# ------------------------- #
##### 0. Project set up #####
# ------------------------- #

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 0.1. Package project creation --------------------------------------------

# First, I created a package named "ppl.tits" (.Rproj) with the following command:
# usethis::create_package("d:/fmartin/Mes documents/projects/pubprivlands/analyses/ppl.tits")
# in which I specified the ABSOLUTE path to my package's folder (alternatively, I could have
# clicked one the buttons in RStudio to "create a package with devtools").
# IMPORTANT NOTE: to recreate this project (or reuse the code in another project), you do not
# need to re-run this line of code and recreate the package's folder because it already exists
# on my Github account.

# Then, I created a "dev history" file to keep track of everything I do in the project:
# usethis::edit_file("_devhistory.R")
# This is the document you are CURRENTLY reading!
# From now on, all command lines used to organize the project will be written in this file.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: in this case, I started a package project from scratch. If I want to start
# from a GitHub repository, the workflow is different but some same steps will be required so
# I encourage my future self to carefully review the steps of this workflow anyway.



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 0.2. Ignoring and keeping track of changes -------------------------------

# First thing first, I will tell R to ignore my _devhistory.R file as it's only for me!
# As this file is not part of a typical package structure, I need to tell R to ignore it
# when checking and installing the package:
usethis::use_build_ignore("_devhistory.R")

# Then, to keep track of all future changes and have a backup, I need to initiate a Git
# version control and link the 'ppl.tits' package with my GitHub account. In this precise case,
# I'm connecting my 'ppl.tits' project AFTER its creation, so I'm following the 'GitHub-last'
# procedure:
# STEP 1: Make sure Git is installed (e.g. by typing 'git status' in the R terminal), if not,
# install it!
# STEP 2: Enter your project and type 'git init' in the R Terminal, it will initiate a Git
# repository within your project:
system("git init") # NOTE: the 'system()' function enables sending commands to the Terminal/CLI,
# that is to work in "command-lines" (hence the name CLI, for "command-lines interface").
# It works yet the problem is that RStudio seems unable to display the CLI responses like a
# regular CLI, preventing interactions with it. That is why I sometimes say that I had to do
# stuff directly in a CLI/Terminal.
# STEP 3: Verify your configuration:
system("git config --global user.name 'fanf'")
system("git config --global user.email 'francois.martin74190@gmail.com'")
# Of course, you need to personalize the user.name and email. If you want the config to be
# only true for the current project (and not global), remove the '--global' from the previous
# lines.
# STEP 4: If you've never done it before (on this computer), you also need to set-up SSH keys
# to be able to connect to Git and GitHub without supplying you username and password every
# time you do something.
# The full procedure is described here: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
# But here goes:
system("ls -al ~/.ssh") # Check for existing SSH keys. If none is found, you must generate one.
system("ssh-keygen -t rsa -C 'francois.martin74190@gmail.com'") # Generates a new SSH key
# using the rsa algorithm (however, I was forced to do that directly in a CLI).
system("eval '$(ssh-agent -s)'") # Checks if the ssh-agent is launched (same --> CLI).
# If it works, it should return something like "Agent pid 59552".
system("ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa") # Adds the new SSH private key to the ssh-agent! (CLI).
# Then you have to add the public key to your GitHub account settings:
# e.g. https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html
system("ssh -T git@github.com") # To check if it works. If it does, it should answer with
# something like "Hi mrelnoob! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does not provide
# shell access". There is clearly a bug in RStudio (or R) that prevents me from doing all
# that from RStudio, but anyway...

# STEP 5: Make some changes in the project and make your first commit:
usethis::use_git(message = ":tada: Initial commit") # Then restart RStudio and the Git tab will
# appear on the top-right box of RStudio.
# STEP 6: Log in your GitHub account and create a new repository (without anything in it).
# STEP 7: Use the following command to associate your R project with the GitHub project:
system2("git remote add origin git@github.com:mrelnoob/ppl.tits") # Here also, personalize
# with your own account and project names! And here again, it does not work (so --> CLI).
# STEP 8: Finally, you can push the changes made to your local files to GitHub:
system2("git push -u origin master") # Same (CLI).
# Even using a CLI (e.g. GitBash), you may receive an error message saying that the remote
# repository contains work that you do not have locally (...). It happens if you included files
# in your GitHub project when you created it (e.g. a README or a LICENCE file). So theoretically,
# you need to always start with a "pull" before you push anything! If, like me, you forgot,
# you'll be in trouble and won't be able to pull. To force Git, you may use "git push -f origin
# master" (the -f means to "force" the push).
# IMPORTANT NOTE: because of the CLI-RStudio bugs, I can "commit" from RStudio but I cannot push,
# so I will always be forced to do it from a CLI every time!



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 0.3. Further basic configurations ----------------------------------------

# Before I go any further, I will edit some information about my package using the DESCRIPTION file.
usethis::edit_file("DESCRIPTION")
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "FranÃ§ois-Marie Martin")# Open-source license
usethis::use_git(message = ":page_facing_up: Edit package metadata")

# To create the package's documentation:
usethis::use_package_doc() # Creates a dummy file in the R folder that should NOT be modified!
devtools::document() # Creates the documentation and the man folder (for "manual").
usethis::use_git(message = ":bulb: Update documentation")





# ----------------------------------- #
##### 1. Project structure set-up #####
# ----------------------------------- #

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 1.1. Folders architecture ------------------------------------------------

# Before writing my first functions to import and clean my data, I need to add the said data files
# in the project folder. So I create a "mydata" folder and copy-paste my data in it (manually):
dir.create("mydata")
usethis::use_build_ignore("mydata") # Because it is not expected in a regular package root folder
# (if I don't ignore it, it will cause warnings in my package checks and all kind of craps.
# I just spent five hours to get rid of them, so trust me).

# I also need other folders to organize my data processing work (e.g. outputs):
dir.create("output")
dir.create("output/plots")
dir.create("output/tables")
dir.create("output/texts")
dir.create("output/spatial_layers")

usethis::use_build_ignore("output/")
usethis::use_build_ignore("tables/")
usethis::use_build_ignore("texts/")
usethis::use_build_ignore("plots/")
usethis::use_build_ignore("spatial_layers/")



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 1.2. Creating scripts for custom functions -------------------------------

# To use pipes (i.e. %>%) everywhere in the package without explicitly loading the {magrittr}
# package:
usethis::use_pipe() # Automatically creates a pipe function (and associated R file in the R folder),
# while updating the DESCRIPTION file to tell R that it should import the "magrittr" package.

usethis::use_r("01_00_import_raw_data")
# NOTE: it automatically places the R file in the R folder (as it should be). The R folder
# should ONLY contain R scripts for functions and NOTHING ELSE! Yet, RStudio may sometimes put
# other things in it, so it is a good idea to go and see once in a while.
usethis::use_r("01_01_prepare_data")
usethis::use_r("01_02_graphab_analyses")



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 1.3. Creating reports (RMarkdown) ----------------------------------------

file.create(... = "output/texts/ppl.tits.exploration_report.Rmd") # Using this command,
# a .Rmd file will be created but will lack the YAML header skeleton that should thus be manually
# placed at the top of the document.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: to ensure proper compatibility with {target}, RMarkdown reports should be
# lightweight. That means they should mostly include text and their chunks of code should be short
# and quickly executed. In other words, R Markdown reports are just targets that document prior
# results. The bulk of the computation should have already happened upstream, and the most of the
# code chunks in the report itself should be terse calls to 'tar_read()' and 'tar_load()'.
# Otherwise, it is of course possible to create reports designed to NOT BE "targets"!


# ** 1.3.1. To manage citations and bibliography ----

# To manage citations and get an automatic bibliography with RMarkdown, I have to follow these
# steps:
#  1) Using Zotero (or something similar), I have to 'export' the references to be cited in the
#     report in a BibTex format (.bib) and place this text file at the root of my package folder.
#  2) Call this document in the `bibliography` field in the YAML metadata header (e.g.
#     bibliography: my_example.bib).
#  3) In text, I use arobases (@) and brackets ([], use semi-colons ";" for separation between
#     references) to add citations (e.g. "@Martin2022 said that..." or "blabla [@Martin2022;
#     see also @Darwin1832]").
# Thus, I pasted my BibTex file at the root of my package folder but I need to tell R to ignore it:
usethis::use_build_ignore("ppl.tits_biblio.bib")
# For practical reasons, this .bib file will certainly be updated many times during the duration
# of the project. Also, it may be useful to manually edit the file to shorten the reference tags
# since Zotero tends to create long tag using the name of the 1st author, the 1st work of the title
# and the year of publication.





# --------------------------------------- #
##### 2. Package content and creation #####
# --------------------------------------- #

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 2.1. Writing functions for the package -----------------------------------

# Now I can write my functions in the R files (= populating my R files) while keeping in mind
# that, for EACH function I create:
#  --> I need to insert a roxygen skeleton to write the documentation.
#  --> I should NOT SOURCE my functions (i.e. I should save my function's file but I should
#      not run the code in it and create "manually" the function I just wrote) to avoid
#      conflicts, see below!
# IMPORTANT NOTE: if a function uses functions from other packages, I need to tell R about
# it by updating the NAMESPACE file (for R to know what to load when it loads my package).
# It will be done automatically by {devtools} when we produce our documentation if we have
# previously listed the dependencies (packages) in the Roxygen2 header of the functions thanks
# to the tags (@import package OR @importFrom package function)! So I do this for every function
# and add the required tags and packages in the function's Roxygen2 header, and I DO NOT FORGET
# to also add these dependencies in the "Imports" field of the DESCRIPTION with the following
# command lines:
usethis::use_package("readr")
usethis::use_package("here")
usethis::use_package("dplyr")
usethis::use_package("tidyr")
usethis::use_package("tidyselect")
usethis::use_package("stats")
usethis::use_package("stringr")
usethis::use_package("degday")
usethis::use_package("missMDA")
usethis::use_package("FactoMineR")
# REMINDER: The NAMESPACE controls what happens when my package is loaded but not when it's
# installed. This is the role of the DESCRIPTION file!
usethis::use_git(message = ":white_check_mark: Updated DESCRIPTION to add new packages")



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 2.2. Load and check the package ------------------------------------------

# The following lines are run iteratively every time a new function is created within
# the package or every time a function is modified. This is the central part that loads,
# inspects (i.e. run the R CMD check) and test my functions and my whole package!


# ** 2.2.1. To load and document functions ----
devtools::load_all() # Now, all functions in the R folder are available!
# IMPORTANT NOTE: if you try to load (or check) your package while working on a new script to
# create new functions (i.e. having unfinished functions in a R file), make sure to put your
# unfinished code as 'comments' (e.g. Ctrl+Shift+C) or you'll get an error! Trust me!

devtools::document() # To create the functions' documentation in the "man" folder, and to
# update the NAMESPACE file of the package (that should NEVER be edited manually).
usethis::use_git(message = ":pencil: Documented new function(s)")
usethis::use_git(message = ":white_check_mark: Updated function(s)")


# ** 2.2.2. To test functions ----
# To test my functions, I could use the "testthat" package:
#usethis::use_testthat()

# Here, I don't want to do real tests because I know my functions work as I want them to.
# For other cases, I should look more closely into that (cf. lesson from N.Casajus FRB-Cesab
# on package building or other online resources)!
# NOTE: All tests files are stored in tests/testthat/ and their names must start with test-*


#  ** 2.2.3. To check the package integrity ----
devtools::check() # Ok!
# IMPORTANT NOTE: I had a lot of PROBLEMS in my first attempts to create a loading function
# because the dataset contained comments in French and English, with special characters and
# punctuation (;,:[] etc.) so R thought that my punctuation was field separators!
# Therefore, NEVER put comments in .csv or .txt files!



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 2.3. To install and version the package ----------------------------------

# ** 2.3.1. Installing the package ----
devtools::install()
usethis::use_git(message = ":metal: Installed updated functions!")
# My package is now installed on my R so I can use its functions whenever I want.


# ** 2.3.2. Set package versions ----
usethis::use_version(which = "minor") # Automatically updates my package version.
usethis::use_news_md() # Creates a NEWS.md file, that I should maintain updated.
usethis::use_git(message = ":package: Release v0.1.0")


# ** 2.3.3. Add and update a README file ----
usethis::use_readme_rmd() # Creates a README.Rmd and adds it automatically to .Rbuildignore
# (and opens it). After manually editing the file, I need to compile it into a .md document
# (otherwise, GitHub and the CRAN won't be able to read and display it on their websites):
rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")
# As render() also produces a .html file that is not useful here, I will ignore it:
usethis::use_build_ignore("README.html")
usethis::use_git_ignore("README.html")

usethis::use_git(message = ":pencil: Edited README")
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Each time you edit the README.Rmd you will have to update the .md
# with rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd") and, of course, you should also commit+push it
# to update GitHub!





# ---------------------------------------------- #
##### 3. Pipeline programming with {targets} #####
# ---------------------------------------------- #

# To ensure maximum reproducibility, help me organize my data processing, and avoid
# wasting too much time every time I have to go back in my code to change something,
# it may be a good idea to use a pipeline programming tool such as {targets} (or 'Drake').
# I won't explain here the advantages of such tools (Google is your friend), but I
# will explain how to use it and associate it while also developing a package to
# process my data (or I'll try).

# If I understand correctly, I think that {targets} and 'package development' can
# be used simultaneously as long as I don't mix the two frameworks up, i.e. they both
# live under the same roof (my project folder), but they don't directly work together:
#   - The 'package' part of my project is here to i) be the fundamental structure of
#     the project and ii) to create (documented) custom functions that I can use
#     wherever I want (in this project or any others). To work fine with {targets},
#     the 'package' part should simply ignore what {targets} is doing and only focus
#     on its own job!
#   - The {targets} part of my project is here to i) organize my data processing
#     workflow, ii) keep track of interconnected elements in the workflow, and iii)
#     only in case of changes (of the data or code), automatically re-run the parts
#     of the code/workflow that are impacted by the changes and leave the other parts
#     as they are! Targets uses the functions made available by the 'ppl.tits' package
#     but it should probably not consider the 'package development' as a goal (a target)
#     in itself, or at least I will prevent it from doing so for the sake of simplicity.
# So that means that the package building tools (e.g. R CMD Check) will have to
# ignore what {targets} is doing and, conversely, that the {targets} files will have
# to ignore what 'devtools' etc. are doing.
# So it means that I WILL HAVE TO manage and run both sides separately and iteratively!



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 3.1. Setting-up the {targets} subproject ---------------------------------

# To create the {targets} master script file:
file.create("_targets.R")
# This is the "master script", where every targets (goal) of the project is defined. It
# should thus be UPDATED every time I progress in my analysis workflow and make a new
# achievement (e.g. producing new results, new data tables, new figures, etc.).
# To know how to specify the workflow, please refer to this file, to section 3.2. below,
# and to online resources!

# To tell devtools to ignore what {targets} does:
usethis::use_build_ignore("_targets.R")
usethis::use_build_ignore("_targets/")
usethis::use_git_ignore("_targets/")

# IMPORTANT NOTE: as I am developing a package {ppl.tits} alongside the {targets} pipeline,
# I will not source my functions but call them directly.
# Consequently, {targets} will not be able to track changes in my functions unless I specify
# it in the {targets} global options (see _targets.R to know how, or refer to online resources
# such as https://books.ropensci.org/targets/packages.html#package-based-invalidation).



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
### * 3.2. Main {targets} functions --------------------------------------------

# To create a target:
targets::tar_target()
# To run the pipeline:
targets::tar_make()
# To load a built target into my R session:
targets::tar_load() # e.g. tar_load(my_target)
# To read and return a built target:
targets::tar_read()
# To show target inter-dependencies:
targets::tar_glimpse()
# To show the complete visual network representation of my workflow:
targets::tar_visnetwork(targets_only = FALSE) # This argument enables the display of global
# functions as well as genuine targets.

### NOTE: Don't forget to fill the README file and to create a _make.R for others to be able
# to reproduce my work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
